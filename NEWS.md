# streamMetabolizer 0.7.3

## Changes

* Remove calc\_schmidt because it is never used

# streamMetabolizer 0.7.2

## Status

This package is not ready for use by many, but it does currently have:

* support for a wide range of non-hierarchical models, both Bayesian and 
MLE-based

* support for regressions of daily K versus discharge and/or velocity

* default specifications for every model

* a maturing user interface for fitting models (probably not quite fixed yet)

* convenience functions for calculating DO saturation concentrations, air 
pressure, depth, solar time, PAR, etc.

* functions for simulating data and error, for testing models with data having 
known underlying parameters

* two small datasets, courtesy of Bob Hall, for testing models with real data
