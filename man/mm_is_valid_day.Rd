\title{Validate one day of data, returning a vector of error strings if needed}
\usage{
mm_is_valid_day(day, day_start = 4, day_end = 27.99, tests = c("full_day",
  "even_timesteps", "complete_data"), timestep_days = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{day}{data for one day}

\item{day_start}{start time of a day's data in number of hours from the 
midnight that begins the modal date. For example, day_start=-1.5 indicates 
that data describing 2006-06-26 begin at 2006-06-25 22:30, or at the first 
observation time that occurs after that time if day_start doesn't fall 
exactly on an observation time.}

\item{day_end}{end time of a day's data in number of hours from the midnight 
that begins the modal date. For example, day_end=30 indicates that data 
describing 2006-06-26 end at 2006-06-27 06:00, or at the last observation 
time that occurs before that time if day_end doesn't fall exactly on an 
observation time.}

\item{tests}{list of tests to conduct}

\item{timestep_days}{the expected timestep length in fraction of a day; for 
example, a 1-hour timestep is 1/24 is 0.0416667. This is calculated within 
the function if timestep_days is NA.}
}
\value{
character vector of errors if day is invalid, or TRUE if it's valid
}
\description{
Provides ability to skip a poorly-formatted day for calculating metabolism, 
without breaking the whole loop. Rather than producing errors, quietly 
collects problems/errors as a list of strings for the calling function to 
handle.
}
\details{
Assumes that the data have already been validated as in 
\code{\link{mm_validate_data}}
}
