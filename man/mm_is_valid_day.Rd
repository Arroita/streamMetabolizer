\title{Validate one day of data, returning a vector of error strings if needed}
\usage{
mm_is_valid_day(day, tests = c("full_day", "even_timesteps", "complete_data"),
  day_start = -1.5, day_end = 30, need_complete = names(day))
}
\arguments{
\item{day}{data for one day}

\item{tests}{list of tests to conduct}

\item{day_start}{argument for 'full_day' test: expected start of day data in
number of hours from the midnight that begins the modal date. For example,
day_start=-1.5 indicates that data describing 2006-06-26 should begin at
2006-06-25 22:30, or as near as possible given the timestep.}

\item{day_end}{argument for 'full_day' test: expected end of day data in
number of hours from the midnight that begins the modal date. For example,
day_end=30 indicates that data describing 2006-06-26 should end at
2006-06-27 06:00, or as near as possible given the timestep.}

\item{need_complete}{character vector of the names of columns in day that
must be complete (without NAs)}
}
\value{
character vector of errors, or empty list
}
\description{
Provides ability to skip a poorly-formatted day for calculating metabolism,
without breaking the whole loop. Rather than producing errors, quietly
collects problems/errors as a list of strings for the calling function to
handle.
}
\details{
Assumes that the data have already been validated as in
\code{\link{mm_validate_data}}
