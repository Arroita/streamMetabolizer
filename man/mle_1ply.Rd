\title{Make daily metabolism estimates from input parameters}
\usage{
mle_1ply(data_ply, data_daily_ply, day_start, day_end, local_date,
  tests = c("full_day", "even_timesteps", "complete_data"),
  model_specs = specs_mle_obserr())
}
\arguments{
\item{data_ply}{a data.frame containing all relevant, validated modeling data
for a single ply of data. (1 ply ~= 1 date, although the day length has
been specified by day_start and day_end and may not be exactly 24 hours)}

\item{data_daily_ply}{NULL or a data.frame containing inputs with a daily
timestep. The local.date column must be present.}

\item{day_start}{start time of a day's data in number of hours from the
midnight that begins the modal date. For example, day_start=-1.5 indicates
that data describing 2006-06-26 begin at 2006-06-25 22:30, or at the first
observation time that occurs after that time if day_start doesn't fall
exactly on an observation time.}

\item{day_end}{end time of a day's data in number of hours from the midnight
that begins the modal date. For example, day_end=30 indicates that data
describing 2006-06-26 end at 2006-06-27 06:00, or at the last observation
time that occurs before that time if day_end doesn't fall exactly on an
observation time.}

\item{local_date}{the modal date of this ply of data and data_daily, and the
date by which this ply should be referred}

\item{tests}{list of tests to conduct}

\item{model_specs}{a list of model specifications and parameters for a model.
Although this may be specified manually, it is easier to use a predefined
function from the \code{specs_xxx} family with a name beginning with
"specs_xxx", where "xxx" is the model type - e.g., "mle", "bayes", "night",
etc. The help files for those functions list the necessary parameters,
describe them in detail, and give default values.}
