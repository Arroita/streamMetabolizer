\arguments{
\item{model_file}{character. The model definition file to use. The file may
be specified either as a file path relative to the streamMetabolizer
models/bayes directory (the first assumption; this directory can be found
with \code{system.file("models/bayes", package="streamMetabolizer")}) or as
an absolute path or a path relative to the current working directory (the
second assumption, if the first assumption turns up no files of the given
name). For example, the default is
\code{"nopool_procobserr_pairmeans.jags"}. The containing folder is in this
case \code{"models/bayes"}. The suffix, 'jags', will determine which MCMC
software package is used. The file name (in this case
\code{"nopool_procobserr_pairmeans.jags"}) will determine not only the
model file to use but also which variables are packaged and sent to the
MCMC software.}

\item{bayes_fun}{character in \code{c('bayes_1ply', 'bayes_all')} indicating
whether the data should be split into daily chunks first ('bayes_1ply') or
passed to the model fitting function in one big chunk ('bayes_all')}

\item{bayes_software}{character in \code{c('jags','stan')} indicating the
software package to use for the MCMC process}

\item{keep_mcmcs}{TRUE, FALSE, or (for nopool models) a vector of dates
  (coerced with as.Date if character, etc.) indicating whether to keep all of
  the mcmc model objects (TRUE), none of them (FALSE), or specific dates. The
  default is FALSE because these objects can be very large.}

\item{GPP_daily_mu}{The mean of a dnorm distribution for GPP_daily, the daily
rate of gross primary production}

\item{GPP_daily_sigma}{The standard deviation of a dnorm distribution for
GPP_daily, the daily rate of gross primary production}

\item{ER_daily_mu}{The mean of a dnorm distribution for ER_daily, the daily
rate of ecosystem respiration}

\item{ER_daily_sigma}{The standard deviation of a dnorm distribution for
ER_daily, the daily rate of ecosystem respiration}

\item{K600_daily_mu}{The mean of a dnorm distribution for K600_daily, the
daily rate of reaeration}

\item{K600_daily_sigma}{The standard deviation of a dnorm distribution for
  K600_daily, the daily rate of reaeration}

\item{err_proc_acor_phi_min}{lower bound on the autocorrelation coefficient
for the autocorrelated component of process [& sometimes observation] error}

\item{err_proc_acor_phi_max}{upper bound on the autocorrelation coefficient
for the autocorrelated component of process [& sometimes observation] error}

\item{err_proc_acor_sigma_min}{lower bound on the standard deviation of the
autocorrelated component of process [& sometimes observation] error}

\item{err_proc_acor_sigma_max}{upper bound on the standard deviation of the
autocorrelated component of process [& sometimes observation] error}

\item{err_proc_iid_sigma_min}{lower bound on the standard deviation of the
uncorrelated (IID) component of process [& sometimes observation] error}

\item{err_proc_iid_sigma_max}{upper bound on the standard deviation of the
  uncorrelated (IID) component of process [& sometimes observation] error}

\item{priors}{logical. Should the data list be modified such that JAGS will
return priors rather than posteriors?}

\item{params_out}{a character vector of parameters whose values in the MCMC
runs should be recorded and summarized}

\item{n_chains}{the number of chains to run}

\item{n_cores}{the number of cores to apply to this run}

\item{burnin_steps}{the number of steps per chain to run and ignore before
starting to collect MCMC 'data'}

\item{saved_steps}{the number of MCMC steps per chain to save}

\item{thin_steps}{the number of steps to move before saving another step. 1
means save all steps.}

\item{verbose}{logical. give status messages?}
