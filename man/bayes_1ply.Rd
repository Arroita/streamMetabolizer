\usage{
bayes_1ply(data_ply, data_daily_ply, day_start = -1.5, day_end = 30,
  local_date, tests = c("full_day", "even_timesteps", "complete_data"),
  model_file, max_cores = 4, adapt_steps = 10, burnin_steps = 40,
  num_saved_steps = 400, thin_steps = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_ply}{a data.frame containing all relevant, validated modeling data
for a single ply of data. (1 ply ~= 1 date, although the day length has
been specified by day_start and day_end and may not be exactly 24 hours)}

\item{data_daily_ply}{NULL or a data.frame containing inputs with a daily
timestep. The local.date column must be present.}

\item{day_start}{start time of a day's data in number of hours from the
midnight that begins the modal date. For example, day_start=-1.5 indicates
that data describing 2006-06-26 begin at 2006-06-25 22:30, or at the first
observation time that occurs after that time if day_start doesn't fall
exactly on an observation time.}

\item{day_end}{end time of a day's data in number of hours from the midnight
that begins the modal date. For example, day_end=30 indicates that data
describing 2006-06-26 end at 2006-06-27 06:00, or at the last observation
time that occurs before that time if day_end doesn't fall exactly on an
observation time.}

\item{local_date}{the modal date of this ply of data and data_daily, and the
date by which this ply should be referred}

\item{tests}{list of tests to conduct}

\item{model_file}{the JAGS model file to use}

\item{max_cores}{the maximum number of cores to apply to this run}

\item{adapt_steps}{the number of steps to use in adapting the model}

\item{burnin_steps}{the number of steps to run and ignore before starting to
collect MCMC 'data'}

\item{num_saved_steps}{the number of MCMC steps to save}

\item{thin_steps}{the number of steps to move before saving another step}
