\title{Prepare data for passing to JAGS}
\usage{
prepjags_bayes(data, data_daily, local_date, model_specs, priors = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data.frame of input data at the temporal resolution of raw
observations. Columns must have the same names, units, and format as the
default. See \code{\link{mm_data}} for a full data description.}

\item{data_daily}{data.frame containing inputs with a daily timestep. See
\code{\link{mm_data}} for a full data description.}

\item{local_date}{the modal date of this ply of data and data_daily, and the
date by which this ply should be referred}

\item{model_specs}{a list of model specifications and parameters for a model.
Although this may be specified manually, it is easier to use a predefined
function from the \code{\link{specs_bayes}} family with a name beginning
with "specs_bayes". The help file for that function lists the necessary
parameters, describes them in detail, and gives default values.}

\item{priors}{logical. Should the data list be modified such that JAGS will
return priors rather than posteriors?}
}
\value{
list of data for input to runjags
}
\description{
This function accepts exactly one day's worth of data, (one ply, which might
be 24 hrs or 31.5 or so), which should already be validated. It prepares the
data needed to run a Bayesian MCMC method to estimate GPP, ER, and K600.
