\usage{
prepjags_bayes(data_ply, model_file, priors = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_ply}{one day's worth of data}

\item{model_file}{the JAGS model file to use}

\item{priors}{logical. Should the data list be modified such that JAGS will
return priors rather than posteriors?}
}
\value{
list of data for input to runjags
}
\description{
This function accepts exactly one day's worth of data, (one ply, which might
be 24 hrs or 31.5 or so), which should already be validated. It prepares the
data needed to run a Bayesian MCMC method to estimate GPP, ER, and K600.
