\usage{
nightreg_1ply(data_ply, data_daily_ply, day_start, day_end, ply_date,
  tests = c("full_day", "even_timesteps", "complete_data"),
  model_specs = specs("n_np_pi_eu_.lm"))
}
\arguments{
\item{data_ply}{a data.frame containing all relevant, validated modeling data
for a single ply of data. (1 ply ~= 1 date, although the day length has 
been specified by day_start and day_end and may not be exactly 24 hours)}

\item{data_daily_ply}{NULL or a data.frame containing inputs with a daily 
timestep. The date column must be present.}

\item{day_start}{start time of a day's data in number of hours from the 
midnight that begins the modal date. For example, day_start=-1.5 indicates 
that data describing 2006-06-26 begin at 2006-06-25 22:30, or at the first 
observation time that occurs after that time if day_start doesn't fall 
exactly on an observation time.}

\item{day_end}{end time of a day's data in number of hours from the midnight 
that begins the modal date. For example, day_end=30 indicates that data 
describing 2006-06-26 end at 2006-06-27 06:00, or at the last observation 
time that occurs before that time if day_end doesn't fall exactly on an 
observation time.}

\item{ply_date}{the modal date of this ply of data and data_daily, and the 
date by which this ply should be referred to}

\item{tests}{list of tests to conduct}

\item{model_specs}{a list of model specifications and parameters for a model.
Although this may be specified manually, it is easier to \code{specs} to 
generate the list. The help file for that functions lists the necessary 
parameters, describes them in detail, and gives default values.}
