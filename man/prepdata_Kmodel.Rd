\usage{
prepdata_Kmodel(data, data_daily, weights, filters, day_start, day_end, tests)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{unit data to aggregate to daily_data. may be NULL.}

\item{data_daily}{daily data to prepare for K modeling}

\item{weights}{character vector indicating the type of weighting to use.
Leave blank or set to c() for no weights.}

\item{filters}{named numeric vector of limits to use in filtering data_daily.
If an element with a name in c("CI.min","discharge.max","velocity.max") is
given, the corresponding filter is applied: K600.upper-K600.lower >=
CI.min, discharge <= discharge.max, velocity <= velocity.max}

\item{day_start}{start time (inclusive) of a day's data in number of hours
from the midnight that begins the date. For example, day_start=-1.5
indicates that data describing 2006-06-26 begin at 2006-06-25 22:30, or at
the first observation time that occurs after that time if day_start doesn't
fall exactly on an observation time. For single days of input data, it is
conventional/useful to begin the day the evening before, e.g., -1.5, and to
end just before the next sunrise, e.g., 30. For multiple consecutive days,
it may make the most sense to start just before sunrise (e.g., 4) and to
end 24 hours later. For nighttime regression to be compatible with this
setup, the date assigned to a section of data should be the date whose
evening contains the data. The default is therefore 12 to 36 for
metab_night, of which the times of darkness will be used.}

\item{day_end}{end time (inclusive) of a day's data in number of hours from
the midnight that begins the date. For example, day_end=30 indicates that
data describing 2006-06-26 end at 2006-06-27 06:00, or at the last
observation time that occurs before that time if day_end doesn't fall
exactly on an observation time. See day_start for recommended start and end
times.}

\item{tests}{list of tests to conduct}
