\usage{
prepdata_Kmodel(data, data_daily, weights, filters, day_start, day_end, tests)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{unit data to aggregate to daily_data. may be NULL.}

\item{data_daily}{daily data to prepare for K modeling}

\item{weights}{For Kmodel, character vector indicating the type of weighting 
to use. Set to c() for no weights. One of c("1/CI", "K600/CI", c()).}

\item{filters}{For Kmodel, named numeric vector of limits to use in filtering
data_daily. Elements may include
c("CI.max","discharge.daily.max","velocity.daily.max"). If an element is
given, the corresponding filter is applied: K600.upper-K600.lower <=
CI.max, discharge.daily <= discharge.daily.max, velocity.daily <= 
velocity.daily.max}

\item{tests}{list of tests to conduct to determine whether each date worth of
data is valid for modeling}
}
