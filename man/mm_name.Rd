\title{Name the Bayesian model with the desired features}
\usage{
mm_name(type = c("bayes", "mle", "night", "sim"), pooling = "none",
  err_obs_iid = c(TRUE, FALSE), err_proc_acor = c(FALSE, TRUE),
  err_proc_iid = c(FALSE, TRUE), ode_method = c("pairmeans", "Euler", "NA"),
  deficit_src = c("DO_mod", "DO_obs", "NA"), bayes_software = c("stan",
  "jags", "nlm", "lm", "rnorm"))
}
\arguments{
\item{type}{the model type, corresponding to the model fitting function
(\code{\link{metab_bayes}}, \code{\link{metab_mle}}, etc.)}

\item{pooling}{Should the model pool information among days to get more
consistent daily estimates?}

\item{err_obs_iid}{logical. Should IID observation error be included? If not,
the model will be fit to the differences in successive DO measurements,
rather than to the DO measurements themselves.}

\item{err_proc_acor}{logical. Should autocorrelated process error (with the
autocorrelation term phi fitted) be included?}

\item{err_proc_iid}{logical. Should IID process error be included?}

\item{ode_method}{The method to use in solving the ordinary differential
equation for DO. Euler: dDOdt from t=1 to t=2 is solely a function of GPP,
ER, DO, etc. at t=1. pairmeans: dDOdt from t=1 to t=2 is a function of the
mean values of GPP, ER, etc. across t=1 and t=2.}

\item{deficit_src}{From what DO estimate (observed or modeled) should the DO
deficit be computed?}

\item{bayes_software}{Which software are we generating code for?}
