\usage{
mm_filter_valid_days(data, data_daily = NULL, tests = c("full_day",
  "even_timesteps", "complete_data"), day_start = 6, day_end = 30,
  timestep_days = NA, need_complete = names(data))
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data.frame of instantaneous observations}

\item{data_daily}{data.frame of daily estimates/statistics, to be filtered in
accordance with the filtering of data}

\item{tests}{list of tests to conduct}

\item{day_start}{expected start of day data in number of hours from the
midnight that begins the modal date. For example, day_start=-1.5 indicates
that data describing 2006-06-26 should begin at 2006-06-25 22:30, or at the
first observation time that occurs after that time if day_start doesn't
fall exactly on an observation time.}

\item{day_end}{expected end of day data in number of hours from the midnight
that begins the modal date. For example, day_end=30 indicates that data
describing 2006-06-26 should end at 2006-06-27 06:00, or at the last
observation time that occurs before that time if day_end doesn't fall
exactly on an observation time.}

\item{timestep_days}{the expected timestep length in fraction of a day; for
example, a 1-hour timestep is 1/24 is 0.0416667. This is calculated within
the function if timestep_days is NA.}

\item{need_complete}{character vector of the names of columns in day that
must be complete (without NAs)}
}
