\usage{
mm_filter_valid_days(data, data_daily = NULL, day_start = 6, day_end = 30,
  tests = c("full_day", "even_timesteps", "complete_data"))
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data.frame of instantaneous observations, to be filtered to only
those points on days that pass the specified tests in mm_is_valid_day}

\item{data_daily}{data.frame of daily estimates/statistics, to be filtered in
accordance with the filtering of data}

\item{day_start}{start time of a day's data in number of hours from the
midnight that begins the modal date. For example, day_start=-1.5 indicates
that data describing 2006-06-26 begin at 2006-06-25 22:30, or at the first
observation time that occurs after that time if day_start doesn't fall
exactly on an observation time.}

\item{day_end}{end time of a day's data in number of hours from the midnight
that begins the modal date. For example, day_end=30 indicates that data
describing 2006-06-26 end at 2006-06-27 06:00, or at the last observation
time that occurs before that time if day_end doesn't fall exactly on an
observation time.}

\item{tests}{list of tests to conduct}
}
\value{
list of data and data_daily with same structure as inputs but with
  invalid days removed, plus a third data.frame of dates that were removed
}
