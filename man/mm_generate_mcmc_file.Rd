}
\arguments{
\item{bayes_software}{Which software are we generating code for?}

\item{ode_method}{The method to use in solving the ordinary differential
equation for DO. Euler: dDOdt from t=1 to t=2 is solely a function of GPP,
ER, DO, etc. at t=1. pairmeans: dDOdt from t=1 to t=2 is a function of the
mean values of GPP, ER, etc. across t=1 and t=2.}

\item{deficit_src}{From what DO estimate (observed or modeled) should the DO
deficit be computed?}
