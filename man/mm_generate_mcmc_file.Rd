}
\arguments{
\item{type}{the model type, corresponding to the model fitting function 
(\code{\link{metab_bayes}}, \code{\link{metab_mle}}, etc.)}

\item{pool_K600}{Should the model pool information among days to get more 
consistent daily estimates for K600? Options: 'none'=no pooling of K600; 
'normal'=K600 ~ 1; 'linear'=K600 ~ 1 + log(Q); 'binned'=K600 ~ cut(Q,
breaks=quantile(Q))}

\item{err_obs_iid}{logical. Should IID observation error be included? If not,
the model will be fit to the differences in successive DO measurements, 
rather than to the DO measurements themselves.}

\item{err_proc_acor}{logical. Should autocorrelated process error (with the 
autocorrelation term phi fitted) be included?}

\item{err_proc_iid}{logical. Should IID process error be included?}

\item{ode_method}{The method to use in solving the ordinary differential 
equation for DO. Euler: dDOdt from t=1 to t=2 is solely a function of GPP, 
ER, DO, etc. at t=1. pairmeans: dDOdt from t=1 to t=2 is a function of the 
mean values of GPP, ER, etc. across t=1 and t=2.}

\item{deficit_src}{From what DO estimate (observed or modeled) should the DO 
deficit be computed?}

\item{engine}{Which software are we generating code for?}
