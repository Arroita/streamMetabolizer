\title{A prototype for the model_fun argument to mm_model_by_ply}
\usage{
mm_model_by_ply_prototype(data_ply, data_daily_ply, ..., day_start, day_end,
  ply_date)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_ply}{a data.frame containing all relevant, validated modeling data
for a single ply of data. (1 ply ~= 1 date, although the day length has 
been specified by day_start and day_end and may not be exactly 24 hours)}

\item{data_daily_ply}{NULL or a data.frame containing inputs with a daily 
timestep. The date column must be present.}

\item{...}{other args that were passed untouched from the function calling 
mm_model_by_ply, through mm_model_by_ply, and finally to this function.}

\item{day_start}{start time of a day's data in number of hours from the 
midnight that begins the modal date. For example, day_start=-1.5 indicates 
that data describing 2006-06-26 begin at 2006-06-25 22:30, or at the first 
observation time that occurs after that time if day_start doesn't fall 
exactly on an observation time.}

\item{day_end}{end time of a day's data in number of hours from the midnight 
that begins the modal date. For example, day_end=30 indicates that data 
describing 2006-06-26 end at the last observation before 2006-06-27 06:00.}

\item{ply_date}{the modal date of this ply of data and data_daily, and the 
date by which this ply should be referred to}
}
\description{
This function does nothing but has the proper form for a model_fun passed to 
mm_model_by_ply. Other functions to be used as model_fun may call 
inheritParams to use the parameter definitions given here.
