\usage{
metab_mle(data = mm_data(local.time, DO.obs, DO.sat, depth, temp.water,
  light), data_daily = mm_data(local.date, K600, optional = "all"),
  info = NULL, day_start = -1.5, day_end = 30, tests = c("full_day",
  "even_timesteps", "complete_data"), calc_DO_fun = calc_DO_mod)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data.frame of input data at the temporal resolution of raw
observations. Columns must have the same names, units, and format as the
default. See \code{\link{mm_data}} for a full data description.}

\item{data_daily}{data.frame containing inputs with a daily timestep. See
\code{\link{mm_data}} for a full data description.}

\item{info}{any information, in any format, that you would like to store
within the metab_model object}

\item{day_start}{start time of a day's data in number of hours from the
midnight that begins the modal date. For example, day_start=-1.5 indicates
that data describing 2006-06-26 begin at 2006-06-25 22:30, or at the first
observation time that occurs after that time if day_start doesn't fall
exactly on an observation time.}

\item{day_end}{end time of a day's data in number of hours from the midnight
that begins the modal date. For example, day_end=30 indicates that data
describing 2006-06-26 end at 2006-06-27 06:00, or at the last observation
time that occurs before that time if day_end doesn't fall exactly on an
observation time.}

\item{tests}{list of tests to conduct}

\item{calc_DO_fun}{the function to use to build DO estimates from GPP, ER,
etc. default is calc_DO_mod, but could also be calc_DO_mod_by_diff}
}
\value{
A metab_mle object containing the fitted model.
}
\description{
Fits a model to estimate GPP and ER from input data on DO, temperature,
light, etc.
