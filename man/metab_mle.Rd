\title{Maximum likelihood metabolism model fitting function}
\usage{
metab_mle(data = mm_data(local.time, DO.obs, DO.sat, depth, temp.water,
  light), K600 = NULL, calc_DO_fun = calc_DO_mod, info = NULL,
  tests = c("full_day", "even_timesteps", "complete_data"),
  day_start = -1.5, day_end = 30)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data.frame with columns having the same names, units, and format
as the default. See \code{\link{mm_data}} for a full data description.}

\item{K600}{Optional. NULL if K600 is to be fitted, or a two-column
data.frame with columns Date (in Date format) and K600 (numeric)
corresponding to all dates to be modeled from \code{data}.}

\item{calc_DO_fun}{the function to use to build DO estimates from GPP, ER,
etc. default is calc_DO_mod, but could also be calc_DO_mod_by_diff}

\item{info}{Any metadata you would like to package within the metabolism
model.}

\item{tests}{list of tests to conduct}

\item{day_start}{argument for 'full_day' test: expected start of day data in
number of hours from the midnight that begins the modal date. For example,
day_start=-1.5 indicates that data describing 2006-06-26 should begin at
2006-06-25 22:30, or as near as possible given the timestep.}

\item{day_end}{argument for 'full_day' test: expected end of day data in
number of hours from the midnight that begins the modal date. For example,
day_end=30 indicates that data describing 2006-06-26 should end at
2006-06-27 06:00, or as near as possible given the timestep.}
}
