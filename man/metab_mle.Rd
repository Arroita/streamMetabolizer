\title{Maximum likelihood metabolism model fitting function}
\usage{
metab_mle(data = mm_data(local.time, DO.obs, DO.sat, depth, temp.water,
  light), data_daily = mm_data(local.date, K600, optional = "all"),
  calc_DO_fun = calc_DO_mod, info = NULL, tests = c("full_day",
  "even_timesteps", "complete_data"), day_start = -1.5, day_end = 30)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data.frame with columns having the same names, units, and format
as the default. See \code{\link{mm_data}} for a full data description.}

\item{data_daily}{Optional. Leave missing if K600 is to be fitted, or give a
three-column data.frame with columns as in default if K600 is to be taken
as given}

\item{calc_DO_fun}{the function to use to build DO estimates from GPP, ER,
etc. default is calc_DO_mod, but could also be calc_DO_mod_by_diff}

\item{info}{Any metadata you would like to package within the metabolism
model.}

\item{tests}{list of tests to conduct}

\item{day_start}{expected start of day data in number of hours from the
midnight that begins the modal date. For example, day_start=-1.5 indicates
that data describing 2006-06-26 should begin at 2006-06-25 22:30, or at the
first observation time that occurs after that time if day_start doesn't
fall exactly on an observation time.}

\item{day_end}{expected end of day data in number of hours from the midnight
that begins the modal date. For example, day_end=30 indicates that data
describing 2006-06-26 should end at 2006-06-27 06:00, or at the last
observation time that occurs before that time if day_end doesn't fall
exactly on an observation time.}
