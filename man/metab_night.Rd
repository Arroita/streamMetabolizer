\title{Nighttime regression for K estimation}
\usage{
metab_night(data = mm_data(local.time, DO.obs, DO.sat, depth, temp.water,
  light), info = NULL, tests = c("full_day", "even_timesteps",
  "complete_data"), day_start = -12, day_end = 12)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data.frame with columns having the same names, units, and format
as the default. See \code{\link{mm_data}} for a full data description.}

\item{info}{Any metadata you would like to package within the metabolism
model.}

\item{tests}{list of tests to conduct}

\item{day_start}{argument for 'full_day' test: expected start of day data in
number of hours from the midnight that begins the modal date. For example,
day_start=-1.5 indicates that data describing 2006-06-26 should begin at
2006-06-25 22:30, or as near as possible given the timestep.}

\item{day_end}{argument for 'full_day' test: expected end of day data in
number of hours from the midnight that begins the modal date. For example,
day_end=30 indicates that data describing 2006-06-26 should end at
2006-06-27 06:00, or as near as possible given the timestep.}
}
\value{
A metab_night object containing the fitted model.
}
\description{
Fits a model to estimate K from nighttime input data on DO, temperature,
light, etc. The default day start & end are 12 noon on the preceding to
present day; the algorithm then filters the data to just those time points
for which light is very low.
