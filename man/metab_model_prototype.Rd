\title{A prototype for the fitting function of each metab_model type}
\usage{
metab_model_prototype(data, data_daily, info, day_start, day_end)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data.frame of input data at the temporal resolution of raw
observations. Columns must have the same names, units, and format as the
default. See \code{\link{mm_data}} for a full data description.}

\item{data_daily}{data.frame containing inputs with a daily timestep. See
\code{\link{mm_data}} for a full data description.}

\item{info}{any information, in any format, that you would like to store
within the metab_model object}

\item{day_start}{start time of a day's data in number of hours from the
midnight that begins the modal date. For example, day_start=-1.5 indicates
that data describing 2006-06-26 begin at 2006-06-25 22:30, or at the first
observation time that occurs after that time if day_start doesn't fall
exactly on an observation time.}

\item{day_end}{end time of a day's data in number of hours from the midnight
that begins the modal date. For example, day_end=30 indicates that data
describing 2006-06-26 end at 2006-06-27 06:00, or at the last observation
time that occurs before that time if day_end doesn't fall exactly on an
observation time.}
}
\description{
This function does nothing but has the proper form for the constructor of an
object inheriting from metab_model. Other constructor functions may call
inheritParams to use the parameter definitions given here.
