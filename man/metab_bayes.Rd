\title{Basic Bayesian metabolism model fitting function}
\usage{
metab_bayes(data = mm_data(local.time, DO.obs, DO.sat, depth, temp.water,
  light), info = NULL, maxCores = 4, adaptSteps = 10, burnInSteps = 40,
  numSavedSteps = 400, thinSteps = 1, tests = c("full_day",
  "even_timesteps", "complete_data"), day_start = -1.5, day_end = 30)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data.frame with columns having the same names, units, and format
as the default. See \code{\link{mm_data}} for a full data description.}

\item{info}{Any metadata you would like to package within the metabolism
model.}

\item{maxCores}{the maximum number of cores to apply to this run}

\item{adaptSteps}{the number of steps to use in adapting the model}

\item{burnInSteps}{the number of steps to run and ignore before starting to
collect MCMC 'data'}

\item{numSavedSteps}{the number of MCMC steps to save}

\item{thinSteps}{the number of steps to move before saving another step}

\item{tests}{list of tests to conduct}

\item{day_start}{argument for 'full_day' test: expected start of day data in
number of hours from the midnight that begins the modal date. For example,
day_start=-1.5 indicates that data describing 2006-06-26 should begin at
2006-06-25 22:30, or as near as possible given the timestep.}

\item{day_end}{argument for 'full_day' test: expected end of day data in
number of hours from the midnight that begins the modal date. For example,
day_end=30 indicates that data describing 2006-06-26 should end at
2006-06-27 06:00, or as near as possible given the timestep.}
