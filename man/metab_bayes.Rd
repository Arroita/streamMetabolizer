\usage{
metab_bayes(data = mm_data(local.time, DO.obs, DO.sat, depth, temp.water,
  light), data_daily = NULL, info = NULL, day_start = -1.5,
  day_end = 30, tests = c("full_day", "even_timesteps", "complete_data"),

}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data.frame of input data at the temporal resolution of raw
observations. Columns must have the same names, units, and format as the
default. See \code{\link{mm_data}} for a full data description.}

\item{data_daily}{data.frame containing inputs with a daily timestep. See
\code{\link{mm_data}} for a full data description.}

\item{info}{any information, in any format, that you would like to store
within the metab_model object}

\item{day_start}{start time of a day's data in number of hours from the
midnight that begins the modal date. For example, day_start=-1.5 indicates
that data describing 2006-06-26 begin at 2006-06-25 22:30, or at the first
observation time that occurs after that time if day_start doesn't fall
exactly on an observation time.}

\item{day_end}{end time of a day's data in number of hours from the midnight
that begins the modal date. For example, day_end=30 indicates that data
describing 2006-06-26 end at 2006-06-27 06:00, or at the last observation
time that occurs before that time if day_end doesn't fall exactly on an
observation time.}

\item{tests}{list of tests to conduct}

\item{model_file}{the JAGS model file to use}

\item{max_cores}{the maximum number of cores to apply to this run}

\item{adapt_steps}{the number of steps to use in adapting the model}

\item{burnin_steps}{the number of steps to run and ignore before starting to
collect MCMC 'data'}

\item{num_saved_steps}{the number of MCMC steps to save}

\item{thin_steps}{the number of steps to move before saving another step}
}
