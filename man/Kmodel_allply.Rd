\title{Fit a K model}
\usage{
Kmodel_allply(data_daily_all, method, weights, predictors, transforms, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_daily_all}{data to use as input, with columns including K600.obs, 
weight, and any predictors}

\item{method}{the name of an interpolation or regression method relating K to
the predictor[s] of choice.}

\item{weights}{character vector indicating the type of weighting to use. 
Leave blank or set to c() for no weights.}

\item{predictors}{character vector of variables (column names in data or 
data_daily) to use in predicting K. Leave blank or set to c() for no 
predictors.}

\item{transforms}{a named character vector of names of functions (probably
'log' or NA) to apply to K600 and/or the predictors. K600 should probably
be logged.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed to the fitting function given by 
\code{method}. \code{na.rm=TRUE} is already passed to \code{mean}}
}
\description{
The model will predict daily K estimates from preliminary daily K estimates. 
Called from metab_Kmodel().
