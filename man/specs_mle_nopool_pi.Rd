\title{MLE estimation with process error only}
\usage{
specs_mle_nopool_pi(calc_DO_fun = calc_DO_mod_by_diff,
  ODE_method = "pairmeans", GPP_init = 3, ER_init = -5, K600_init = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{calc_DO_fun}{the function to use to build DO estimates from GPP, ER,
etc. default is calc_DO_mod, but could also be calc_DO_mod_by_diff}

\item{ODE_method}{character specifying the numerical integration method to
use. The default is pairmeans, where the change in DO between times t-1 and
t is a function of the mean DO.sat between times t-1 and t, mean temp.water
between times t-1 and t, mean light between times t-1 and t, etc. The Euler
method is currently more common in the literature, with each time step
depending entirely on DO.sat, GPP, etc. at time t. Both methods are
imprecise and fast, relative to Runge-Kutta or other numerical integration
methods}

\item{GPP_init}{the inital value of daily GPP to use in the NLM fitting
process}

\item{ER_init}{the inital value of daily ER to use in the NLM fitting process}

\item{K600_init}{the inital value of daily K600 to use in the NLM fitting
process. Ignored if K600 is supplied in data_daily, except for those dates
where K600 is NA. If there are any such dates, K600_init must have a
numeric (non-NA) value, as this will be used to estimate K600 for those
dates.}

\description{
Maximum likelihood estimation of GPP, ER, and optionally also K600, assuming
error in [only] the process of reaching DO.obs[t+1] from DO.obs[t]
