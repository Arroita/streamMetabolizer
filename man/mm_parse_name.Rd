\title{Parse a model name into its features}
\usage{
mm_parse_name(model_name)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_name}{character: the model name}
}
\description{
Returns a data.frame with one column per model structure detail and one row 
per `model_name` supplied to this function. See \code{?\link{mm_name}} for a 
description of each of the data.frame columns that is returned.
}
\details{
Custom model files (for MCMC) may have additional characters after an 
underscore at the end of the name and before the prefix. For example, 
'b_np_pcpi_eu_ko.stan' and 'b_np_pcpi_eu_ko_v2.stan' are parsed the same; the
_v2 is ignored by this function.

The converse of this function is \code{\link{mm_name}}.
