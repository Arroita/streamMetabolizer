\item{maxCores}{the maximum number of cores to apply to this run}

\item{adaptSteps}{the number of steps to use in adapting the model}

\item{burnInSteps}{the number of steps to run and ignore before starting to
collect MCMC 'data'}

\item{thinSteps}{the number of steps to move before saving another step}
}
\value{
a data.frame of outputs

\description{
Seems to need to import rjags but does not, for now, because I can't get
rjags to install on the Condor cluster. Including an import rjags line here
allowed runjags to do its job last time I tried.
