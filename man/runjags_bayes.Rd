\usage{
runjags_bayes(data_list, model_path, params_out, max_cores = 4,
  adapt_steps = 1000, burnin_steps = 4000, num_saved_steps = 40000,

\arguments{
\item{data_list}{a formatted list of inputs to the JAGS model}

\item{model_path}{the JAGS model file to use, as a full file path}

\item{params_out}{a character vector of parameters whose values in the MCMC
runs should be recorded and summarized}

\item{max_cores}{the maximum number of cores to apply to this run}

\item{adapt_steps}{the number of steps to use in adapting the model}

\item{burnin_steps}{the number of steps to run and ignore before starting to
collect MCMC 'data'}

\item{num_saved_steps}{the number of MCMC steps to save}

\item{thin_steps}{the number of steps to move before saving another step}
}
\value{
a data.frame of outputs
}
\description{
Seems to need to import rjags but does not, for now, because I can't get
rjags to install on the Condor cluster. Including an import rjags line here
allowed runjags to do its job last time I tried.
