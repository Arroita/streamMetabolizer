\title{Split and label data into >=24-hr days for fitting daily metabolism}
\usage{
mm_model_by_ply(model_fun, data, data_daily, day_start, day_end, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_fun}{the function to apply to each data ply. This function should
accept the arguments \code{c(data, data_daily, ..., day_start, day_end, 
ply_date)} where \code{data_daily} is \code{NULL} when the 
\code{data_daily} argument to \code{mm_model_by_ply} is missing or 
\code{NULL}}

\item{data}{required. the data.frame containing all relevant, validated 
modeling data. The solar.time column must be present.}

\item{data_daily}{optional. a data.frame containing inputs with a daily 
timestep. The date column must be present.}

\item{day_start}{start time (inclusive) of a day's data in number of hours 
from the midnight that begins the date. For example, day_start=-1.5 
indicates that data describing 2006-06-26 begin at 2006-06-25 22:30, or at 
the first observation time that occurs after that time if day_start doesn't
fall exactly on an observation time. For metabolism models working with 
single days of input data, it is conventional/useful to begin the day the 
evening before, e.g., -1.5, and to end just before the next sunrise, e.g., 
30. For multiple consecutive days, it may make the most sense to start just
before sunrise (e.g., 4) and to end 24 hours later. For nighttime 
regression, the date assigned to a chunk of data should be the date whose
evening contains the data. The default is therefore 12 to 36 for
metab_night, of which the times of darkness will be used.}

\item{day_end}{end time (exclusive) of a day's data in number of hours from 
the midnight that begins the date. For example, day_end=30 indicates that 
data describing 2006-06-26 end at the last observation time that occurs 
before 2006-06-27 06:00. See day_start for recommended start and end times.}

\item{...}{other args to be passed through mm_model_by_ply to model_fun}
}
\value{
a data.frame of model results
}
\description{
Splits up to two data.frames, data and data_daily, into date-specific chunks.
These are passed to model_fun, and the results of model_fun (which must be a 
data.frame) are modified to include the data as a first column, then 
row-bound together into a single data.frame containing results from all days.
