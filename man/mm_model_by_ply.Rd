\usage{
mm_model_by_ply(data, model_fun, day_start, day_end, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{the data.frame containing all relevant, validated modeling data}

\item{model_fun}{the function to apply to each data ply}

\item{day_start}{argument for 'full_day' test: expected start of day data in
number of hours from the midnight that begins the modal date. For example,
day_start=-1.5 indicates that data describing 2006-06-26 should begin at
2006-06-25 22:30, or as near as possible given the timestep.}

\item{day_end}{argument for 'full_day' test: expected end of day data in
number of hours from the midnight that begins the modal date. For example,
day_end=30 indicates that data describing 2006-06-26 should end at
2006-06-27 06:00, or as near as possible given the timestep.}

\item{...}{additional args passed to model_fun (data, day_start, and day_end
will also be passed)}
}
\value{
a data.frame of fitting results
}
