\title{Split and label data into >=24-hr days for fitting daily metabolism}
\usage{
mm_model_by_ply(model_fun, data, data_daily, day_start, day_end, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_fun}{the function to apply to each data ply. This function should
accept the arguments \code{c(data, data_daily, ..., day_start, day_end, local_date)}
where \code{data_daily} is \code{NULL} when the \code{data_daily} argument
to \code{mm_model_by_ply} is missing or \code{NULL}}

\item{data}{required. the data.frame containing all relevant, validated 
modeling data. The local.time column must be present.}

\item{data_daily}{optional. a data.frame containing inputs with a daily 
timestep. The local.date column must be present.}

\item{day_start}{start time of a day's data in number of hours from the 
midnight that begins the modal date. For example, day_start=-1.5 indicates 
that data describing 2006-06-26 begin at 2006-06-25 22:30, or at the first 
observation time that occurs after that time if day_start doesn't fall 
exactly on an observation time.}

\item{day_end}{end time of a day's data in number of hours from the midnight 
that begins the modal date. For example, day_end=30 indicates that data 
describing 2006-06-26 end at 2006-06-27 06:00, or at the last observation 
time that occurs before that time if day_end doesn't fall exactly on an 
observation time.}

\item{...}{other args to be passed through mm_model_by_ply to model_fun}
}
\value{
a data.frame of model results
}
\description{
Splits up to two data.frames, data and data_daily, into date-specific chunks.
These are passed to model_fun, and the results of model_fun (which must be a 
data.frame) are modified to include the data as a first column, then 
row-bound together into a single data.frame containing results from all days.
