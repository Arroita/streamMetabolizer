\title{Helper to predict_DO.metab_model}
\usage{
mm_predict_1ply(data, data_daily, calc_DO_fun, metab_ests, day_start, day_end,
  local_date)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a data.frame of predictor data for a single ply (~day)}

\item{calc_DO_fun}{the function to use to build DO estimates from GPP, ER,
etc. default is calc_DO_mod, but could also be calc_DO_mod_by_diff}

\item{metab_ests}{a data.frame of metabolism estimates for all days, from
which this function will choose the relevant estimates}

\item{day_start}{arg passed from mm_model_by_ply and ignored here}

\item{day_end}{arg passed from mm_model_by_ply and ignored here}

\item{local_date}{the single date to which data and data_daily refer}
}
\value{
a data.frame of predictions
}
\description{
Usually assigned to model_fun within mm_model_by_ply, called from there
}
