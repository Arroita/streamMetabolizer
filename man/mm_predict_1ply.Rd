\usage{
mm_predict_1ply(data_ply, calc_DO_fun, metab_ests, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_ply}{a data.frame of predictor data for a single ply (~day)}

\item{calc_DO_fun}{the function to use to build DO estimates from GPP, ER,
etc. default is calc_DO_mod, but could also be calc_DO_mod_by_diff}

\item{metab_ests}{a data.frame of metabolism estimates for all days, from
which this function will choose the relevant estimates}

\item{...}{additional args passed from mm_model_by_ply and ignored here}
}
\value{
a data.frame of predictions
}
\description{
Usually assigned to model_fun within mm_model_by_ply, called from there
