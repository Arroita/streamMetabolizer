\usage{
specs_sim_basic(err.obs.sigma = 0.1, err.obs.phi = 0, err.proc.sigma = 0,
  err.proc.phi = 0, ODE_method = "pairmeans", sim.seed = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{err.obs.sigma}{The sd of observation error, or 0 for no observation
error. Observation errors are those applied to DO.mod after generating the
full time series of modeled values.}

\item{err.obs.phi}{The autocorrelation coefficient of the observation errors,
or 0 for uncorrelated errors.}

\item{err.proc.sigma}{The sd of process error, or 0 for no process error.
Process errors are applied at each time step, and therefore propagate into
the next timestep.}

\item{err.proc.phi}{The autocorrelation coefficient of the process errors, or
0 for uncorrelated errors.}

\item{ODE_method}{character specifying the numerical integration method to
use. The default is pairmeans, where the change in DO between times t-1 and
t is a function of the mean DO.sat between times t-1 and t, mean temp.water
between times t-1 and t, mean light between times t-1 and t, etc. The Euler
method is currently more common in the literature, with each time step
depending entirely on DO.sat, GPP, etc. at time t. Both methods are
imprecise and fast, relative to Runge-Kutta or other numerical integration
methods}

\item{sim.seed}{NA to specify that each call to predict_DO should generate
  new values, or an integer, as in the \code{seed} argument to
  \code{\link{set.seed}}, specifying the seed to set before every execution
  of predict_DO}
