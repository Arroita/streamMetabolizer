\title{Prepare data for passing to JAGS or Stan}
\usage{
prepdata_bayes(data, data_daily, local_date, model_specs, priors = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data.frame of input data at the temporal resolution of raw 
observations. Columns must have the same names, units, and format as the 
default. See \code{\link{mm_data}} for a full data description.}

\item{data_daily}{data.frame containing inputs with a daily timestep. See 
\code{\link{mm_data}} for a full data description.}

\item{local_date}{the modal date of this ply of data and data_daily, and the 
date by which this ply should be referred}

\item{model_specs}{a list of model specifications and parameters for a model.
Although this may be specified manually, it is easier to \code{specs} to 
generate the list. The help file for that functions lists the necessary 
parameters, describes them in detail, and gives default values.}

\item{priors}{logical. Should the data list be modified such that JAGS will 
return priors rather than posteriors?}
}
\value{
list of data for input to runjags_bayes or runstan_bayes
}
\description{
This function accepts exactly one day's worth of data, (one ply, which might 
be 24 hrs or 31.5 or so), which should already be validated. It prepares the 
data needed to run a Bayesian MCMC method to estimate GPP, ER, and K600.
